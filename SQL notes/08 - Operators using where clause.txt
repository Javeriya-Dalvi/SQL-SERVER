----------------------------

AND operator is used when we need both condition must be satisfied

OR operator is used when atleast 1 conditions should be satisfied

< , > , <= , >= , = , < >

IN operator is used to find multiple list of numeric as well as text values at a time

The "NOT" operator in SQL is used to negate a condition or expression, essentially reversing its logic meaning. It's used to filter rows that do not meet a specified condition. For example:

- `NOT condition` : Returns rows that do not satisfy the given condition.
- `NOT EXISTS` : Checks for the absence of rows in a subquery result
- `NOT LIKE` : Filters rows that do not match a specified pattern.
- `NOT IN` : Filters rows that are not included in a specified list of values.

In short, the "NOT" operator is used to express the opposite or negation of a given condition or criteria in SQL queries.

BETWEEN operator is used for the range comparision

NOT BETWEEN operator is used to check out of the given range

LIKE operator is used for pattern comparision (contains,alphabets,wildcard characters)

Wildcard chars:
---------------

% => 0 or many chars

_ => exactly 1 char
