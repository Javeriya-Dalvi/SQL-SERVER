=> SQL is originally introduced by IBM and initial name    of this language was SEQUEL and later it is renamed    to SQL
=> SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language).

user uses => SSMS =>to connect SQL server => to communicate with DB
 
=> Based on operations over DB SQL is categorized into following sub-languages.

	DML (Data Manipulation Language),
	DRL (Data Retrival Language),
	TCL (Transaction Control Language),
	DCL (Data Control Language)
