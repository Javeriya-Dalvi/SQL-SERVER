Interview Question : choice based

SELECT * 
FROM emp
WHERE job IN ('clerk','%man%');

a)Error
b)returns clerk,manager, salesman records
c)returns only clerk
d)none

ANSWER : (c)

Reason : The correct interpretation of the query is as follows :

The IN operator is used to check if the value of the job column is exactly one of the values in the list: 'clerk' and '%man%'

The value 'clerk' is an exact match, so it will select records with the job title "clerk"

The value '%man% is not a wildcard pattern within the IN operator
Instead,
it's treated as a literal string. so, it will select records where the job title is exactly "%man%, not where it contains "manager" or any other job title.

Given this explanation, the correct answer is:

(c) returns only clerk

- if you have to specify group of multiple character assuming that they are all starting alphabets of words then the characters are written in '[]' square brackets

E.g. :-
=> name starts with 'a','c','j','s'
Query => SELECT *
	FROM emp
	WHERE ename LIKE '[acjs]%';

[ ] => to specify group of characters

=> name starts between 'a' and 'p' (a to p)
Query => SELECT *
	FROM emp
	WHERE ename LIKE '[a-p]%';

=>[ - ] to specify range of characters
--------------------

IS operator :-
------------
=>used for NULL comparision

	WHERE colname IS NULL
	WHERE colname IS NOT NULL
---------------------

ORDER BY :
-----------
=> ORDER BY clause is used to sort data based one one or more columns either in ascending or in descending order

Syntax: SELECT *
	FROM tablename
	ORDER BY columnName ASC/DESC

By default it is sort in ascending order.
In ORDER BY we can use columnName or columnNumber to sort the data but column number is not based on table, it is based on column names in select query

=> arrange emp list dept wise asc and in dept, sal wise desc ?

SELECT *
FROM tblname
ORDER BY dept ASC, sal DESC;

It will sort data first in dept wise in ascending order and then it will sort department wise salary in descending order.

Q: display employees working as clerk, manager and arrange output sal wise desc order?
A: SELECT *
   FROM emp
   WHERE jobrole in ('clerk','manager') 
   ORDER BY sal DESC;
